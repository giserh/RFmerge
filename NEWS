--------------------------
0.1-0   15-Dec-2019
        o First release
        o It depends on R >= 3.5.0 because serialized objects (.rds data files) in serialize/load version 3 cannot be read in older versions
        o RMarkdown vignette was replaced by a sttic PDF  one to avoid dependencies from rgdal, hydroTSM, and hydroGOF.

0.1-1   18-Dec-2019
        o Full PDF vignette was replaced by a  minimal RMarkdown version to avoid dependencies from rgdal, hydroTSM, and hydroGOF.

0.1-2   18-Dec-2019
        o The package was built using the "--compact-vignettes="gs+qpdf"  to avoid the following WARNIG from CRAN: "'gs+qpdf' made some significant size reductions".

0.1-3   20-Dec-2019
        o 'RFmerge.R': new argument 'write2disk' to allow the user to choose whether the output merged layers should be written to disk or not. Default value is 'FALSE'. 
        o 'RFmerge.R': 'installed.packages()' was replaced by 'find.package', for increasing efficiency to find out if a named package is installed or not.
        o examples are now run within a 'donttest{}' piece of code instead of a '\dontrun{}' one.
        o a maximum of two cores is used in all examples, even if the number of cores available is much larger than that (required by CRAN)
        o RFmerge.Rd: '\value' tag was added, explaining the returning object of the function
        o Hengl et al. (2018) was added as a reference' did not match any file(s) known to git
